This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## What's next? How do I make an app with this?

We try to keep this project as simple as possible, so you can start with just the scaffolding we set up for you, and add additional things later when they become necessary.

## Tech stack

I have used **PlanetScale** to deploy our ready to use Production Grade database.

Implement Rate limiting so that user's doesn't spam chat using **Upstah**.
